One of the most important questions in computer science is "<img  align="right" width ="150" height ="150" src = "https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/532272/21507867/3376e9fe-cc4a-11e6-9350-7ec4f680da36.gif" >
How do I make the computer do what I want it to do?" The answer is to formulate a computational rule that leads to the desired
that leads to the desired result and consists of a series of steps ¨
which are simple enough to be executed by the computer. Such a rule is called an algorithm.
is called an algorithm (after the mathematician Abu Dscha'far
Muhammad ibn Musa al-Chwarizmi, who published a book of computational methods in the 9th century).
